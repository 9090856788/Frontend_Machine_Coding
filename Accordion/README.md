# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

#Requirement

- Create a react application using vite. 
- Configure the application.
- Create a dummy mock data for showing on the frontend.
- Make a single instance of the accordion component.
- Map all the data in multiple component using map method.
- Write the style in the style sheet for making application looks better.
